Another year has passed, and not only have we failed to lose weight, but we haven't taken up all those hobbies we said we would. At the end of each year, we get a burst of clarity, all of a sudden we can see what needs fixing, both in our business and personal lives. Then, we choose the perfect day to begin - January 1; a holiday for most of us, and a day that might include a late start due to a late night. What a lousy day to begin a new routine.
