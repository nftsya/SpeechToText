August was named after the Roman Emperor Augustus.
It has 31 days because Augustus wanted as many days as July, which was named after Julius Caesar.
In a leap year August begins on the same day of the week as February.
In the UK there is a bank holiday on the last Monday in August.
Traditionally many businesses close on bank holidays.
