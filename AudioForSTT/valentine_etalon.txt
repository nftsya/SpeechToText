Valentine's Day takes place on February 14. It's the day of the year when couples show their love. Some people pick one person and call them their "Valentine". You can send your Valentine a Valentine card, some flowers, chocolates, or just a nice gift. Valentine cards usually have pictures of hearts or flowers and contain some sort of poem, message, or even a secret code. Valentine's day gives some people the courage to show their true feelings to the person they love.
